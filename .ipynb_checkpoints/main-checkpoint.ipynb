      "This file provides starter code for extracting features from the xml files and\n",
      "for doing some learning.\n",
      "The basic set-up: \n",
      "----------------\n",
      "main() will run code to extract features, learn, and make predictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "extract_feats() is called by main(), and it will iterate through the \n",
      "train/test directories and parse each xml file into an xml.etree.ElementTree, \n",
      "which is a standard python object used to represent an xml file in memory.\n",
      "(More information about xml.etree.ElementTree objects can be found here:\n",
      "http://docs.python.org/2/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html\n",
      "and here: http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2012/03/15/processing-xml-in-python-with-elementtree/)\n",
      "It will then use a series of \"feature-functions\" that you will write/modify\n",
      "in order to extract dictionaries of features from each ElementTree object.\n",
      "Finally, it will produce an N x D sparse design matrix containing the union\n",
      "of the features contained in the dictionaries produced by your \"feature-functions.\"\n",
      "This matrix can then be plugged into your learning algorithm.\n",
      "The learning and prediction parts of main() are largely left to you, though\n",
      "it does contain code that randomly picks class-specific weights and predicts\n",
      "the class with the weights that give the highest score. If your prediction\n",
      "algorithm involves class-specific weights, you should, of course, learn \n",
      "these class-specific weights in a more intelligent way.\n",
      "Feature-functions:\n",
      "--------------------\n",
      "\"feature-functions\" are functions that take an ElementTree object representing\n",
      "an xml file (which contains, among other things, the sequence of system calls a\n",
      "piece of potential malware has made), and returns a dictionary mapping feature names to \n",
      "their respective numeric values. \n",
      "For instance, a simple feature-function might map a system call history to the\n",
      "dictionary {'first_call-load_image': 1}. This is a boolean feature indicating\n",
      "whether the first system call made by the executable was 'load_image'. \n",
      "Real-valued or count-based features can of course also be defined in this way. \n",
      "Because this feature-function will be run over ElementTree objects for each \n",
      "software execution history instance, we will have the (different)\n",
      "feature values of this feature for each history, and these values will make up \n",
      "one of the columns in our final design matrix.\n",
      "Of course, multiple features can be defined within a single dictionary, and in\n",
      "the end all the dictionaries returned by feature functions (for a particular\n",
      "training example) will be unioned, so we can collect all the feature values \n",
      "associated with that particular instance.\n",
      "Two example feature-functions, first_last_system_call_feats() and \n",
      "system_call_count_feats(), are defined below.\n",
      "The first of these functions indicates what the first and last system-calls \n",
      "made by an executable are, and the second records the total number of system\n",
      "calls made by an executable.\n",
      "What you need to do:\n",
      "--------------------\n",
      "1. Write new feature-functions (or modify the example feature-functions) to\n",
      "extract useful features for this prediction task.\n",
      "2. Implement an algorithm to learn from the design matrix produced, and to\n",
      "make predictions on unseen data. Naive code for these two steps is provided\n",
      "below, and marked by TODOs.\n",
      "Computational Caveat\n",
      "--------------------\n",
      "Because the biggest of any of the xml files is only around 35MB, the code below \n",
      "will parse an entire xml file and store it in memory, compute features, and\n",
      "then get rid of it before parsing the next one. Storing the biggest of the files \n",
      "in memory should require at most 200MB or so, which should be no problem for\n",
      "reasonably modern laptops. If this is too much, however, you can lower the\n",
      "memory requirement by using ElementTree.iterparse(), which does parsing in\n",
      "a streaming way. See http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2012/03/15/processing-xml-in-python-with-elementtree/\n",
      "for an example."
